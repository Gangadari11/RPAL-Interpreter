let x = 5 in x + 3

Here's how the parser would process this:

Initialization:

The parser receives a list of tokens from the lexer: [KEYWORD "let", IDENTIFIER "x", PUNCTUATION "=", INTEGER "5", KEYWORD "in", IDENTIFIER "x", OPERATOR "+", INTEGER "3"]
It initializes an empty AST


Parsing starts at E() (the entry point):

Sees "let" token, recognizes this as a let expression
Consumes "let" token
Calls D() to parse the definition part

Inside D():

Calls Da() to parse the basic definition
Inside Da(), calls Dr() then Db()
Db() sees identifier "x", consumes it, creates IDENTIFIER node for "x"
Consumes "=" token
Calls E() to parse the expression "5"
E() calls Ew(), which calls T(), and so on down the chain until Rn()
Rn() creates INTEGER node for "5"
Returns to Db() which creates EQUAL node with children [IDENTIFIER "x", INTEGER "5"]


Back in E() for the "in" part:

Consumes "in" token
Calls E() again to parse the expression "x + 3"
This calls down to A() which handles the "+" operator
Creates nodes for IDENTIFIER "x" and INTEGER "3"
Creates PLUS node with children [IDENTIFIER "x", INTEGER "3"]


Finishing the let expression:

Creates LET node with children [EQUAL node, PLUS node]
The complete AST represents "let x = 5 in x + 3"

AST Conversion:

The parser then converts this AST to a string representation with indentation
The string representation would look something like:
let
.=
..<IDENTIFIER:x>
..<INTEGER:5>
.+
..<IDENTIFIER:x>
..<INTEGER:3>


This string representation shows the hierarchical structure of the program, where dots represent indentation levels. Each node shows its type and, for leaf nodes like identifiers and integers, also shows their values.
The parser follows the grammar rules defined in each method to correctly build this tree structure. It's essentially implementing a recursive descent parser that translates the linear sequence of tokens into a tree structure that represents the nested nature of the programming language constructs.
